# CLAUDE.md — cronicon (Cronicón Mayoricense, Palma 1881)

OCR pilot for Campaner's chronicle of Mallorca, 1229–1800. Part of the Corpus
Balear family; same conventions as the sibling projects in `../`.

## Golden rules

- **Repo content in English** (code, comments, docs, commits). Any UI copy is
  Catalan. The transcribed text stays in Campaner's 1881 Spanish, verbatim.
- **No generative model in the transcription path.** Ever. Not to read a page, not
  to "clean up" OCR, not to break a tie. The consensus of independent recognisers
  is the entire guarantee; an LLM writing text into the transcription voids it.
  `../nomenclators/madoz/README.md` §Difficulties documents what happens
  otherwise. LLMs may read facsimile crops to *adjudicate* between engine
  readings — verification with the evidence on screen — and nothing more.
- **Never modernise.** `formacion`, `dia`, `Setiembre`, `mallorquin`, `á`, `ó`
  stand as printed, and so do Campaner's own typos. The BNE ABBYY layer silently
  writes `formación`; that is an error, not a fix.
- **Nix for tools, uv for Python, both locked.** `flake.nix` pins Tesseract *and*
  its language set (`spa_old spa cat lat eng osd`) inside the project rather than
  touching `~/Setups/macos`. Never `brew`.

## Toolchain

```sh
nix develop     # tesseract + uv + openjpeg, pinned by flake.lock
uv sync         # .venv from uv.lock (uv-managed CPython, not conda/miniforge)
```

Scripts are run as `python scripts/<name>.py` (they import their siblings; Python
puts `scripts/` on the path automatically). All are idempotent and skip existing
output, so re-running is safe and cheap.

## What is established

Measured, not assumed — see `docs/OCR_BENCHMARK.md`:

- Two independent scans exist: BNE (200 dpi, in `data/raw/`) and Internet
  Archive/Google (~630 dpi). **IA leaf = BNE PDF page − 2.**
- Best single engine: Tesseract `spa_old+cat+lat` on the IA scan at 300 dpi,
  94.5%. `cat`+`lat` are worth ~1.5 points — the book quotes Catalan and Latin,
  and the cedilla in Mallorcan surnames needs the Catalan model.
- Six-engine majority vote: 97.25%. Where all six agree (70% of tokens) they were
  right 360/360, bounding shared errors at ≤0.83% (95%, one-sided).
- **Do not stack two Tesseract variants on the same image in the panel.** It
  scores higher (97.51%) but only by voting with itself; unanimity is the
  guarantee and near-clones corrupt it. One engine per scan.
- Upscaling is not resolution: Tesseract on the BNE scan interpolated to 600 dpi
  scores *worse* than the same engine at native 200 dpi.
- Reviewing the contested ~3% of words (~16 000 decisions) reaches ~1 error in
  200 across the book's ~489 000 words.
- **Review crops must be at native resolution.** Adjudicating from 78-px-tall
  crops produced one wrong call (`asi` for `así`); at full resolution the accent
  is obvious. Accent-vs-dot is exactly what most disagreements turn on.
- **A drawn sample is data. Never regenerate it.** `data/adjudication/sample*.json`
  are committed and `sample_loci.py` now refuses to overwrite them without
  `--force`. The strata depend on every engine's output, so *any* engine
  improvement changes which positions get drawn — repairing the ABBYY-IA parser
  renumbered the sample and orphaned all 550 adjudications. `benchmark.py`
  verifies a fingerprint of `(id, page, index)` and hard-fails on a mismatch;
  when it fires, restore the sample from git rather than re-drawing.

## Structure of the book

Surveyed by `scripts/inventory.py` over all 671 leaves → `data/inventory.json`:

| section | PDF leaves | notes |
|---|---|---|
| front matter | 0–13 | covers, title |
| introduction | 14–27 | describes each manuscript source; the sigla glossary lives here |
| body | 28–630 | the chronicle |
| appendices | 631–638 | I: Jurats of the 18th c. II: noticias curiosas |
| advertencias | 639–641 | notes on the plates |
| errata + plates | 642–670 | |

614 leaves carry running text; 57 are plates or blanks.

Body is a chronicle by year: a bare year heading (`1229.`), then entries of the
form `Mes día.—texto…—SIGLA`, where the sigla name the manuscript source
(`B. J.` Bartolomé Jaume, `G. T.` Guillermo Terrassa, `L. V.` Luis de
Villafranca, `Jn. Br.`, `T. A.`…).

Layout, detected by `scripts/layout.py` clustering line left edges — not by
looking for an empty gutter, which fails because ABBYY's line boxes overrun it:
body is 2-column (519 leaves), but **15 body leaves are 3–6 column tables** —
further Jurats lists for the 14th and 15th centuries at leaves 114 and 225 and
their continuations. Same hard class as the appendix name list, which scored
worst in the pilot. Introduction and errata are 1-column.

**The body is not all chronicle**, and counting columns does not find the parts
that are not. `parse_entries.py` classifies the 614 leaves into three kinds and
writes the split to `data/entries/sections.json`:

- **519 chronicle leaves** — the dated entries.
- **27 Jurats name lists.** `inventory.py` finds the ones that print in 3–6
  columns and misses the ones typeset as two: leaves 58–60 (13th c.) and 114–121
  (14th, headed `APÉNDICES. I.`) read as ordinary body. They are found instead by
  content — numbered names, `AÑO 1332.` labels — and a table run also **spills
  onto the leaf after it** (229, 242, 482, 502 open with the last names of the
  table before them).
- **41 leaves of documents printed in full** — `II. Cartas del gobernador
  Gilaberto de Centellas`, `IV. Fragmentos de las Apuntaciones del Notario Mateo
  Salcet`, and a dozen more. Each dates its own material, so leaf 153 runs 1382,
  1384, 1387 in the middle of the 1340s. They are found by the fact that no year
  they state can be true where they sit.

Beware the inverse: a long stretch with no year heading is **not** evidence of an
appendix. Leaves 253–280 are 28 leaves of continuous Germanía narrative, real
chronicle, with no heading between 1520 and 1525.

**ABBYY does not read the large display headings at all** — the letterspaced
`APÉNDICES` on leaf 631 and `INTRODUCCION.` on leaf 14 are simply absent from the
embedded layer. Section boundaries are therefore anchored on ordinary body text
(`SECTION_ANCHORS` in `inventory.py`), and each anchor must match exactly one
leaf or the script fails rather than guessing.

**BNE↔IA alignment is a constant offset of −2** across the whole book: 377 leaves
confirm it, spanning pdf 16–635. The 60 that appear to contradict it are ABBYY
dropping the leading digit of the running head (`5^ CRONICON` for 54). Never
drive the mapping off the per-leaf printed number — an earlier version did and
mapped leaf 211 to IA leaf 29.

## Finding year headings

Measured, after geometry was tried and dropped. A display heading is **not**
identifiable by its box: real ones sit anywhere from the centre of their column
to 47% off it, and one at the top of a column occupies the same vertical band
(y 0.088–0.123) as the running head's page number (0.080–0.099). Three rules that
do work, in the order they matter:

1. **Ask the panel, not the winner.** A heading is five characters wide, so the
   vote has almost nothing to work with and the winner is often the worst reading
   on the line: `I3II.` won a three-way tie on leaf 66 while PaddleOCR had
   plainly read `1311.`. Count the year across all eight readings and require
   three of them. This is recovery from evidence, not character substitution —
   the same rule that forbids an LLM rewriting a word allows counting what the
   recognisers actually returned. It is also why lines whose winner collapsed to
   `1`, `I`, `r.` or `M.` are still readable: leaves 178, 203, 302, 470 and 516
   were checked against the facsimile and all five are real headings.
2. **The line must say nothing but a year** — otherwise `1700 lbs.`, `1,259
   carros`, `hasta 1343.`, `Any 1522` and `á 1558.)` all become years. The one
   exception is the heading the line finder glued to the start of its own entry
   (`1460. Marzo`, 16 readings; `1776. MARZO`), admitted only when the panel
   reads a month or an opening quote after the year. That single case was worth
   26 years on its own.
3. **The chronicle only moves forward.** Keep the longest non-decreasing run of
   candidates and report the rest. This is the guard that lets rules 1 and 2 be
   generous, and it is what exposed the two real oddities in the whole book.

493 → 519 distinct years of 572, and the 53 still missing are mostly genuine:
29 have no trace of a heading anywhere between the years that bracket them —
Campaner simply had no news. Only two candidates in the book break the
chronology, and neither is an OCR error:

- **leaf 39 prints `1449.`** and the entry beneath it reads «año de 1249,
  perseverando…». Campaner's own error; by this edition's rules it stays.
- **leaf 74 `1336.»`** is the last line of a footnote quotation, wrapped alone.

## Where we left off (27 Jul 2026)

Panel of six is measured and closed pending one open experiment.

- **Kraken fine-tune: rejected.** 96.7% on body pages — better than any panel
  engine — yet the seven-engine consensus made the queue *worse*: 26 298 -> 35 328
  contested (+34%). Accuracy and complementarity are different things. Model kept
  at `models/cronicon/best_0.9985.safetensors` for reference.
- **PaddleOCR PP-OCRv6: in progress.** 96.2% on body pages and, unusually, 73% on
  the *contested* tier where the best panel engine manages 48%. That profile is
  what a seventh vote actually needs. Its full-book run was interrupted partway;
  `scripts/ocr_paddle.py --pages all` is idempotent and resumes.
- **Next command:** finish that run, then
  `consensus.py --pages all --with-paddle` and compare its contested count against
  the 26 298 of the six-engine panel. That single number decides whether the panel
  opens to seven.
- **Scope decision:** the introduction (12 leaves) is dropped from the edition, but
  its glossary of manuscript sigla must still be extracted by hand — the body's
  source attributions are meaningless without it.

## Backlog

- [x] Tighten the shared-error bound — 360 unanimous positions adjudicated, none
      wrong, bound ≤0.83%. `scripts/sample_loci.py --round N` draws disjoint
      further rounds (draw them **in order**; each excludes its predecessors);
      `benchmark.py` merges every `sample*.json` it finds and refuses to run if
      the sample fingerprint no longer matches the adjudicated one.
- [x] Inventory and classify all 671 leaves (`scripts/inventory.py`), align
      BNE↔IA for every one. Surfaced the 15 multi-column body tables the pilot
      had missed; the review projection now derives from it.
- [ ] Fetch the full IA image set (`fetch_ia.py --images`, 1.6 GB, 667 leaves) and
      convert (`prepare_ia_pages.py`). Archive.org drops the transfer regularly,
      hence the resume loop.
- [ ] Full-book run of the six-engine panel (~10 min), then consensus + conflict
      queue. Recompute the review projection: changing the panel changes the
      strata, so the ~16 000 figure has to be re-derived.
- [ ] Keyboard-driven review tool: native-resolution crop on screen, variants as
      numbered choices, decisions to an append-only file keyed so re-runs replay
      them.
- [ ] Deterministic normalisation with the rules written down (hyphen stitching,
      small caps, running heads) — `docs/EDITORIAL.md`.
- [ ] Parse into the chronicle structure; sigla glossary from the introduction.
- [ ] Static SPA on Cloudflare Workers, Catalan UI, `cronicon.corpusbalear.org`,
      plus a card in `../portal/web/index.html` and its JSON-LD `hasPart`.
