# CLAUDE.md — cronicon (Cronicón Mayoricense, Palma 1881)

OCR pilot for Campaner's chronicle of Mallorca, 1229–1800. Part of the Corpus
Balear family; same conventions as the sibling projects in `../`.

## Golden rules

- **Repo content in English** (code, comments, docs, commits). Any UI copy is
  Catalan. The transcribed text stays in Campaner's 1881 Spanish, verbatim.
- **No generative model in the transcription path.** Ever. Not to read a page, not
  to "clean up" OCR, not to break a tie. The consensus of independent recognisers
  is the entire guarantee; an LLM writing text into the transcription voids it.
  `../nomenclators/madoz/README.md` §Difficulties documents what happens
  otherwise. LLMs may read facsimile crops to *adjudicate* between engine
  readings — verification with the evidence on screen — and nothing more.
- **Never modernise.** `formacion`, `dia`, `Setiembre`, `mallorquin`, `á`, `ó`
  stand as printed, and so do Campaner's own typos. The BNE ABBYY layer silently
  writes `formación`; that is an error, not a fix.
- **Nix for tools, uv for Python, both locked.** `flake.nix` pins Tesseract *and*
  its language set (`spa_old spa cat lat eng osd`) inside the project rather than
  touching `~/Setups/macos`. Never `brew`.

## Toolchain

```sh
nix develop     # tesseract + uv + openjpeg, pinned by flake.lock
uv sync         # .venv from uv.lock (uv-managed CPython, not conda/miniforge)
```

Scripts are run as `python scripts/<name>.py` (they import their siblings; Python
puts `scripts/` on the path automatically). All are idempotent and skip existing
output, so re-running is safe and cheap.

## What is established

Measured, not assumed — see `docs/OCR_BENCHMARK.md`:

- Two independent scans exist: BNE (200 dpi, in `data/raw/`) and Internet
  Archive/Google (~630 dpi). **IA leaf = BNE PDF page − 2.**
- Best single engine: Tesseract `spa_old+cat+lat` on the IA scan at 300 dpi,
  94.5%. `cat`+`lat` are worth ~1.5 points — the book quotes Catalan and Latin,
  and the cedilla in Mallorcan surnames needs the Catalan model.
- Six-engine majority vote: 97.25%. Where all six agree (70% of tokens) they were
  right 360/360, bounding shared errors at ≤0.83% (95%, one-sided).
- **Do not stack two Tesseract variants on the same image in the panel.** It
  scores higher (97.51%) but only by voting with itself; unanimity is the
  guarantee and near-clones corrupt it. One engine per scan.
- Upscaling is not resolution: Tesseract on the BNE scan interpolated to 600 dpi
  scores *worse* than the same engine at native 200 dpi.
- Reviewing the contested ~3% of words (~16 000 decisions) reaches ~1 error in
  200 across the book's ~489 000 words.
- **Review crops must be at native resolution.** Adjudicating from 78-px-tall
  crops produced one wrong call (`asi` for `así`); at full resolution the accent
  is obvious. Accent-vs-dot is exactly what most disagreements turn on.
- **A drawn sample is data. Never regenerate it.** `data/adjudication/sample*.json`
  are committed and `sample_loci.py` now refuses to overwrite them without
  `--force`. The strata depend on every engine's output, so *any* engine
  improvement changes which positions get drawn — repairing the ABBYY-IA parser
  renumbered the sample and orphaned all 550 adjudications. `benchmark.py`
  verifies a fingerprint of `(id, page, index)` and hard-fails on a mismatch;
  when it fires, restore the sample from git rather than re-drawing.

## Structure of the book

Surveyed by `scripts/inventory.py` over all 671 leaves → `data/inventory.json`:

| section | PDF leaves | notes |
|---|---|---|
| front matter | 0–13 | covers, title |
| introduction | 14–27 | describes each manuscript source; the sigla glossary lives here |
| body | 28–630 | the chronicle |
| appendices | 631–638 | I: Jurats of the 18th c. II: noticias curiosas |
| advertencias | 639–641 | notes on the plates |
| errata + plates | 642–670 | |

614 leaves carry running text; 57 are plates or blanks.

Body is a chronicle by year: a bare year heading (`1229.`), then entries of the
form `Mes día.—texto…—SIGLA`, where the sigla name the manuscript source
(`B. J.` Bartolomé Jaume, `G. T.` Guillermo Terrassa, `L. V.` Luis de
Villafranca, `Jn. Br.`, `T. A.`…).

Layout, detected by `scripts/layout.py` clustering line left edges — not by
looking for an empty gutter, which fails because ABBYY's line boxes overrun it:
body is 2-column (519 leaves), but **15 body leaves are 3–6 column tables** —
further Jurats lists for the 14th and 15th centuries at leaves 114 and 225 and
their continuations. Same hard class as the appendix name list, which scored
worst in the pilot. Introduction and errata are 1-column.

**The body is not all chronicle**, and counting columns does not find the parts
that are not. `parse_entries.py` classifies the 614 leaves into three kinds and
writes the split to `data/entries/sections.json`:

- **519 chronicle leaves** — the dated entries.
- **27 Jurats name lists.** `inventory.py` finds the ones that print in 3–6
  columns and misses the ones typeset as two: leaves 58–60 (13th c.) and 114–121
  (14th, headed `APÉNDICES. I.`) read as ordinary body. They are found instead by
  content — numbered names, `AÑO 1332.` labels — and a table run also **spills
  onto the leaf after it** (229, 242, 482, 502 open with the last names of the
  table before them).
- **41 leaves of documents printed in full** — `II. Cartas del gobernador
  Gilaberto de Centellas`, `IV. Fragmentos de las Apuntaciones del Notario Mateo
  Salcet`, and a dozen more. Each dates its own material, so leaf 153 runs 1382,
  1384, 1387 in the middle of the 1340s. They are found by the fact that no year
  they state can be true where they sit.

Beware the inverse: a long stretch with no year heading is **not** evidence of an
appendix. Leaves 253–280 are 28 leaves of continuous Germanía narrative, real
chronicle, with no heading between 1520 and 1525.

**ABBYY does not read the large display headings at all** — the letterspaced
`APÉNDICES` on leaf 631 and `INTRODUCCION.` on leaf 14 are simply absent from the
embedded layer. Section boundaries are therefore anchored on ordinary body text
(`SECTION_ANCHORS` in `inventory.py`), and each anchor must match exactly one
leaf or the script fails rather than guessing.

**BNE↔IA alignment is a constant offset of −2** across the whole book: 377 leaves
confirm it, spanning pdf 16–635. The 60 that appear to contradict it are ABBYY
dropping the leading digit of the running head (`5^ CRONICON` for 54). Never
drive the mapping off the per-leaf printed number — an earlier version did and
mapped leaf 211 to IA leaf 29.

## Finding year headings

Measured, after geometry was tried and dropped. A display heading is **not**
identifiable by its box: real ones sit anywhere from the centre of their column
to 47% off it, and one at the top of a column occupies the same vertical band
(y 0.088–0.123) as the running head's page number (0.080–0.099). Three rules that
do work, in the order they matter:

1. **Ask the panel, not the winner.** A heading is five characters wide, so the
   vote has almost nothing to work with and the winner is often the worst reading
   on the line: `I3II.` won a three-way tie on leaf 66 while PaddleOCR had
   plainly read `1311.`. Count the year across all eight readings and require
   three of them. This is recovery from evidence, not character substitution —
   the same rule that forbids an LLM rewriting a word allows counting what the
   recognisers actually returned. It is also why lines whose winner collapsed to
   `1`, `I`, `r.` or `M.` are still readable: leaves 178, 203, 302, 470 and 516
   were checked against the facsimile and all five are real headings.
2. **The line must say nothing but a year** — otherwise `1700 lbs.`, `1,259
   carros`, `hasta 1343.`, `Any 1522` and `á 1558.)` all become years. The one
   exception is the heading the line finder glued to the start of its own entry
   (`1460. Marzo`, 16 readings; `1776. MARZO`), admitted only when the panel
   reads a month or an opening quote after the year. That single case was worth
   26 years on its own.
3. **The chronicle only moves forward.** Keep the longest non-decreasing run of
   candidates and report the rest. This is the guard that lets rules 1 and 2 be
   generous, and it is what exposed the two real oddities in the whole book.

493 → 519 distinct years of 572, and the 53 still missing are mostly genuine:
29 have no trace of a heading anywhere between the years that bracket them —
Campaner simply had no news. Only two candidates in the book break the
chronology, and neither is an OCR error:

- **leaf 39 prints `1449.`** and the entry beneath it reads «año de 1249,
  perseverando…». Campaner's own error; by this edition's rules it stays.
- **leaf 74 `1336.»`** is the last line of a footnote quotation, wrapped alone.

## The Jurats lists

Six series, one per century, printed as appendices inside the body:
XIII at leaf 58, XIV at 114, XV at 225, XVI at 311, XVII at 478, XVIII at 631.
`scripts/parse_jurats.py` finds them by their own title line and gives
`data/jurats/jurats.jsonl` — **1 670 names over 282 years**, one row per
(year, seat, name) with its certainty tier.

Two typographies, and **neither difficulty is in the parser**. What the six
engines share is a reading order, and it comes from Tesseract's line
segmentation, which is wrong on these leaves in two different ways.

- **Compact form** (a bare `1418.` and six names, three columns to the leaf) —
  Tesseract joins a line of column one to a line of column two across the
  gutter: leaf 312 opens `Pedro Descatlar. Alfonso`, one box from x 0.10 to
  0.81, and every year heading caught in such a line vanishes. Circular, too:
  `layout.find_columns` refuses a boundary more than a tenth of the lines cross,
  so the merged lines hide the boundary that would separate them.
  **Fixed** by `consensus.py --split-gutter`, which cuts a line where the gap in
  it exceeds 0.025 of the page width — word spaces here are 0.0066, and leaf 312
  had 34 gaps over 0.03 against 3 on a clean table leaf. Worth 12 years and 77
  names. It writes to `consensus…_gutter`, never over the book's consensus:
  changing geometry changes every stratum and would orphan the frozen sample.
- **Annotated form** (`AÑO 1312.`, `1.—Guillermo de Montsó` with a dot leader to
  a brace, and a column of notes on which manuscript gives which name, leaves
  58–60 and 114–121) — **still open.** Tesseract returns nothing at all right of
  x 0.47 on leaf 115, so the notes column is absent from the panel entirely.
  `consensus.py --geometry abbyy-ia` recovers it in full (out to x 0.89) but
  leaves the name column no better.
- Not by having a model read the page. Family names of 1300s Mallorca are
  exactly where a language model silently normalises `Za-flor` to `Zaflor` and
  invents a plausible surname, with no consensus left to catch it.

Bounding each series: it ends at the next series' title, at a roman-numeral
section head (`II. Noticias é indicaciones curiosas` starts at 1702 on the leaf
right after the 18th-century list, rising years, so nothing else stops it), or at
the first leaf that adds no year beyond those already collected. Within a series
the same non-decreasing-subsequence rule as the chronicle: one heading misread
high on leaf 479 was locking out twenty consecutive years.

## The appendix blocks

At the close of each century the chronicle stops and an appendix runs for six to
sixty-nine leaves. `scripts/parse_documents.py` delimits them →
`data/documents/documents.json`: **6 blocks, 27 numbered sections, 187 leaves.**

A block is *not* identifiable by length: leaves 253–280 are twenty-eight leaves
of continuous Germanía narrative and are chronicle. What every block does have is
the Jurats list at its head, numbered `I`; so a block runs from a Jurats series
to the leaf where the chronicle states its next year, and sections run `II`
onward. Three traps, all measured:

- **Quoted ordinances number their own clauses** — leaf 85 has `III. Item, com
  sia slat dit al Sr. Rey…` seven times. Excluded by requiring a block's
  numerals to rise, and by rejecting a title beginning `Item`.
- **The numeral shares a line with the running head**: leaf 153 opens `126 IV.`.
- **The numerals are display type, which is the class the engines read worst.**
  Leaf 482 prints `II.` and the vote returned `XX.`, having been offered `zz.`,
  `LL.`, `IH.`, `TIT.` and one correct `II.` from Apple Vision. Read the numeral
  off the panel, exactly as with the year headings. Because that evidence is
  weaker, a section found that way must be the *next* number, not merely a later
  one — without that constraint a chronicle entry on leaf 632 became section V.

Three numerals in the 16th-century block are still not found (VII, VIII, X).
Leaves 333–334 are blank and leaf 332 ends *«haber reducido el tamaño de las tres
primeras páginas á las dimensiones del original»*: section VII is a **facsimile
reprint of a 1541 booklet**, leaves 335–367, carrying its own title page in its
own typography. The gap is explained, not mysterious.

## The non-Spanish material — measured coverage is zero

The book embeds letters, edicts and relations in medieval Catalan and Latin. Two
things are true and must not be confused:

- The panel is *equipped* for it: Tesseract runs `spa_old+cat+lat`, worth ~1.5
  points precisely because of these quotations, and the arbitration lexicon is
  built from this book rather than from a Spanish dictionary.
- **Nothing on those leaves has ever been measured.** All 550 adjudicated
  positions fall on twelve leaves — 14, 17, 20, 30, 34, 36, 50, 200, 627, 629,
  631, 642 — and **none of them is a document leaf**. The 97.6% figure covers
  chronicle prose, the introduction, one Jurats table and the errata. The 159
  document leaves are unmeasured.

## The long s — fixed, and the shape of the fix

Leaves 335–367 reproduce a 1541 booklet in its own typography, which uses `ſ`.
Five of six engines read it as `f`. `scripts/editorial.py` repairs **1 481
tokens**; the rule is written up in `docs/EDITORIAL.md` and applied in
`build_text.py`, and every word it touches keeps the panel's reading under
`printed`.

The lesson worth keeping is the veto. Tesseract `spa_old` does read the long s —
`coſa`, `moſſen`, `boſſer`, `eſtigueſſen` — and is outvoted, so preferring its
reading recovers most of it. **But an engine reading `ſ` is evidence, not
proof:** leaf 342 prints `fonch` and leaf 362 `fins` with a full crossbar (real
`f`, both real Catalan words) and Tesseract offers `ſonch` and `ſins` anyway.
Repairing on the panel alone would have corrupted 47 tokens of good text. So a
repair is refused whenever the printed form is a word the book uses elsewhere,
outside the reprint:

| outcome | tokens |
|---|---|
| repaired, an engine read it | 1 292 |
| repaired, attested on the reprint | 189 |
| ambiguous — real word, `f` stands, sent to review | 465 |
| untouched — no engine ever read `ſ` | 542 |

`fe`, `fa` and `fi` are knowingly left wrong: they are `ſe`, `ſa`, `ſi` on the
page *and* real words. Leaving a real reading unrepaired is recoverable;
corrupting a real word is not.

Also: **derive the affected leaves from the consensus, never from
`data/text/`** — that is the rule's own output, and reading the signal from it
made the detection vanish the moment the repair had run once.

## Where we left off (27 Jul 2026)

Panel of six is measured and closed pending one open experiment.

- **Kraken fine-tune: rejected.** 96.7% on body pages — better than any panel
  engine — yet the seven-engine consensus made the queue *worse*: 26 298 -> 35 328
  contested (+34%). Accuracy and complementarity are different things. Model kept
  at `models/cronicon/best_0.9985.safetensors` for reference.
- **PaddleOCR PP-OCRv6: in progress.** 96.2% on body pages and, unusually, 73% on
  the *contested* tier where the best panel engine manages 48%. That profile is
  what a seventh vote actually needs. Its full-book run was interrupted partway;
  `scripts/ocr_paddle.py --pages all` is idempotent and resumes.
- **Next command:** finish that run, then
  `consensus.py --pages all --with-paddle` and compare its contested count against
  the 26 298 of the six-engine panel. That single number decides whether the panel
  opens to seven.
- **Scope decision:** the introduction (12 leaves) is dropped from the edition, but
  its glossary of manuscript sigla must still be extracted by hand — the body's
  source attributions are meaningless without it.

## Backlog

- [x] Tighten the shared-error bound — 360 unanimous positions adjudicated, none
      wrong, bound ≤0.83%. `scripts/sample_loci.py --round N` draws disjoint
      further rounds (draw them **in order**; each excludes its predecessors);
      `benchmark.py` merges every `sample*.json` it finds and refuses to run if
      the sample fingerprint no longer matches the adjudicated one.
- [x] Inventory and classify all 671 leaves (`scripts/inventory.py`), align
      BNE↔IA for every one. Surfaced the 15 multi-column body tables the pilot
      had missed; the review projection now derives from it.
- [ ] Fetch the full IA image set (`fetch_ia.py --images`, 1.6 GB, 667 leaves) and
      convert (`prepare_ia_pages.py`). Archive.org drops the transfer regularly,
      hence the resume loop.
- [ ] Full-book run of the six-engine panel (~10 min), then consensus + conflict
      queue. Recompute the review projection: changing the panel changes the
      strata, so the ~16 000 figure has to be re-derived.
- [ ] Keyboard-driven review tool: native-resolution crop on screen, variants as
      numbered choices, decisions to an append-only file keyed so re-runs replay
      them.
- [x] Deterministic normalisation with the rules written down — `docs/EDITORIAL.md`.
      One rule so far (the long s), plus the two typographic transforms that were
      already happening (hyphen stitching, running heads).
- [ ] Parse into the chronicle structure; sigla glossary from the introduction.
- [ ] Static SPA on Cloudflare Workers, Catalan UI, `cronicon.corpusbalear.org`,
      plus a card in `../portal/web/index.html` and its JSON-LD `hasPart`.
